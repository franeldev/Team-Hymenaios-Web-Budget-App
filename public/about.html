		<h2>Early in 2018…</h2>
		<p>A group of aspiring developers called Hymenaios met themselves at the HNG workspace and decided to develop a system that grew into something quite useful. It really boiled down to four simple rules:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We decided what we wanted our money to do before we spent it.</li>
			<li>We broke up larger, less-frequent expenses into manageable “monthly bills.”</li>
			<li>We changed our budget as needed.</li>
			<li>We only spent money that was at least thirty days “old.”</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Living this way, and seeing how absolutely invaluable the Four Rules were, we wanted to spread the word. BLUEBOX was officially launched in September 2019.</p>

		<h1 class="display-4 trend">7 Marketing Trends To Budget For In 2019/2020.</h1>
	</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="col-12">
		<p class="lead">As you’re looking back at the year’s successes and (let’s face it) shortcomings, it’s important to look ahead to what the marketing industry as a whole has in store in the near future and to seek out new opportunities to engage your audience. To help, here are seven marketing trends that leaders or businesspersons should consider as they’re preparing to budget for 2020:</p>
		<div class="text-left">
			<p class="lead"><b>1. Content has become core to marketing (and sales, too).</b></p>
			<p>Content has become core to everything your marketing team does, so you absolutely have to budget for it. If you haven’t already, create a content marketing plan. And if you have created a strategy, take some time to revisit it, make sure it aligns with the direction you’re wanting to go in 2020, and determine that you have the resources you need.</p>
			<p>Content has become the fuel for so many of your marketing and sales departments’ biggest goals, and your budget should reflect that.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>2. Chatbots will offer benefits beyond customer service.</b></p>
			<p>Chatbots can help you meet your audience members where they are and inform your marketing strategy with insights directly from them at the same time.</p>
			<p>Not only do chatbots give you insight into exactly what your audience members are looking for and when, but they also make it easy to deliver that information to them — all while collecting those insights to refine your messaging in the future. It’s a win-win,and that’s why it should be on your radar in 2019.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>3. Alternative search formats are on the rise.</b></p>
			<p>Google announcing plans to make visual content more useful in search, marketers need to be prepared for the rise of alternative search.</p>
			<p>According to the recent research I mentioned earlier, more than half of marketers increased their use of image-based content, and more than one-third increased audio-only content. This indicates marketers are moving in the right direction by producing more and different types of content for audiences. But if you’re creating different kinds of content without also thinking through how your audience will find it, it’s not going to do a lot of good. As we go into 2020, prioritizing multimedia content and alternative search will be important.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>4. Marketing and PR will continue to overlap.</b></p>
			<p>PR has evolved a lot in recent years. It’s less about the templated, mass-distributed messaging of the past and much more about engaging content that’s valuable to brands, reporters, and their audiences. Now if helpful, engaging content sounds familiar, that’s because it’s central to what marketing is all about. Marketing and PR can and should work together to enhance each other and deliver more value to your audience — and your bottom line.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>5. Security and data privacy will be major concerns.</b></p>
			<p>Online security and the protection of personal information are growing demands for all consumers, and marketing leaders must accommodate this development. The 2018 rollout of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU was a big step in that direction. As audience trust in media declines and concern over privacy grows, marketers will need to put the processes in place to responsibly collect, store, and protect their audience members’ information to maintain the trust they’ve worked so hard to earn.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>6. Personalization and authenticity will separate successful marketers from those who just contribute to noise.</b></p>
			<p>To be honest, there’s no good reason in this day and age for anyone to receive generic messages and completely irrelevant offers in his or her inbox (or anywhere, for that matter). With the endless amount of data you have available, the technology that can analyze it and help you put it to use, and the tools available to scale that information across interactions, your audience members should feel special all the time.</p>
			<p>They’re already bombarded with more content than they can handle, and you don’t want to just add to the noise. Technology doesn’t have to make you more impersonal. It can make marketers better communicators.</p>
			<p class="lead"><b>7. Less will be more.</b></p>
			<p>In an article about trends to consider for 2020, I know it probably sounds weird to say that maybe we should be trying fewer things, but hear me out.</p>
			<p>So rather than dive headfirst into each trend as it emerges, remember the members of your audience and what is truly best for them. That should be your guiding light. Assess everything carefully, make sure you’ve got a plan to actually measure whatever you try, and always prioritize your audience experience.</p>
			<p>Hopefully these seven marketing trends that are shaping the industry will help you as you sit down to allocate dollars, pounds, nairas in blueBox and set goals for 2020.</p>
